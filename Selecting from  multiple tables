In SQL we can retrieve data from multiple tables also by using SELECT with multiple tables which actually results in CROSS JOIN of all the tables. The resulting
table occurring from CROSS JOIN of two contains all the row combinations of the 2nd table which is a Cartesian product of tables. If we consider table1 
contains m rows and table2 contains n rows then the resulting table after selecting two tables i.e cross join of two tables contains m*n rows.

select * from emp, dept;

select e.ename, d.deptno from emp e, dept d;
