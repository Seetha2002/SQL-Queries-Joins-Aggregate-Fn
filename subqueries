In SQL a Subquery can be simply defined as a query within another query. In other words we can say that a Subquery is a query that is embedded in WHERE clause 
of another SQL query.

Syntax:
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name expression operator 
    ( SELECT COLUMN_NAME  from TABLE_NAME   WHERE ... );
    
Example:
select dname from dept 
where dept in
(select deptno from emp where sal between 1000 and 2000)
