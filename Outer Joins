The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

Example:
SELECT e.ename, d.deptno
FROM emp e, dept d
FULL OUTER JOIN dept ON e.deptno=d.deptno
ORDER BY d.deptno;
